				Hi, my name is Mauro Vargas. I am a dedicated full-stack PHP developer with a strong focus on creating custom WordPress themes. My expertise includes a variety of essential plugins, such as Gravity Forms, Yoast SEO, WP Rocket, and Advanced Custom Fields, as well as developing custom plugins to meet specific client requirements. I am skilled at working with legacy code and have a proven ability to refactor it when necessary.		  </p><br>
				<p>
				A self-starter by nature, I excel at troubleshooting and resolving issues independently. My familiarity with a range of hosting providers, including GoDaddy, WP Engine, and Pantheon, complements my background in technical support.
		  </p><br>
		  <p>
				In my daily work, I utilize a diverse set of technologies and tools, such as MySQL, Git, Webpack, Vue, Vanilla JavaScript, Twig, Figma, Lando, and Docker. I thrive in collaborative environments and have effectively partnered with project managers and designers to deliver solutions that align with clients' needs and expectations.

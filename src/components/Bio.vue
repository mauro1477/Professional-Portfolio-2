					I am a proud former U.S. Marine with a deep passion for coding and technology.  I hold a B.A. in Computer Science. My academic journey included comprehensive coursework in design and logic, computer systems, data structures, algorithms, databases, and web development. Over the last seven years, I have honed my skills while working with one of the largest lobbying firms in Washington, D.C. As a Software Developer, I excel at working with open software, backend servers, and APIs to meet clients' needs. I am experienced in the Google Cloud Platform(GCP) and leverage Google's API Services. I have a robust background in capturing events and transforming data into actionable insights. My ability to pivot when necessary ensures that we stay aligned with business objectives and drive impactful decisions. I take pride in my strong collaboration skills, which have allowed me to work effectively with subcontractors, project managers, and designers to deliver exceptional results.
